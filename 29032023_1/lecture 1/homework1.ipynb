    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Code comes in languages. This has at least two implications. First, if you know just one programming language, you may not be able to communicate with everyone, and you may occasionaly need to learn a new language. Python is a general-purpose language. It can be used for data analysis, but also for mathematical economics and simulations. In this course, we will apply Python to economic topics you learn in other courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, every language has its own peculiarities. The problem with programming languages is that often they are very sensitive about their peculiarities. Usually code is case-sensitive and it matters a lot whether you use, e.g. `;` or `,` and `(`, `{` or `[`. As a result, you will often make typos that result in error massages. Errors are a normal aspect of programming. Typos that do not result in errors are worse, because then your code may do something else than you want it to do!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you will often encounter errors, you need to learn to solve them. Often you can easily find the source of the problem by carefully reading the error message. But sometimes the error message is uninformative. If this is the case, it often helps to temporarily remove parts of the code until you no longer get error messages. In this way you can locate the problematic part of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also urge you to use google (or other search engines like DuckDuckGo) and stackoverflow. Some students find this weird at the beginning: should we not teach you everything that you need to know? The answer is no for a number of reasons. First, even professional programmers use google and stackoverflow all the time. Second, python and R are open source and lots of people work with it. If you encounter a problem, chances are that someone else had the same problem and knows the solution to it. There is not need to “invent the wheel”. Use the resources available to you. If you copy a lot of code, you should add a reference. Finally, because python and R are open source, they develop rapidly. The things that we teach you now, will be obsolete in a couple of years time. Hence, you need to be able to find your way around also in 10 years time. To start practicing this, use google now.\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing the assignments, you can google any problems that you encounter. If circumstances allow, the exam is done in a shielded exam environment at the university, or with proctoring at home. Then you face restrictions on browsing the internet. Hence, we will also practice getting help on Python in a Jupyter notebook."

    "We teach python in a way that may seem counter-intuitive to you at first sight. Our starting point is that you are not doing an engineering/IT degree; you are an economist. Hence, we are interested in economic applications; not so much in the details of the python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you need to learn the basics of the language, things like data-types, control structures etc. In other words, you need to know what a list is, a dictionary, a numpy array, a pandas dataframe, how to define functions, use list comprehension, if-then-else structures etc. This “technical” part you mainly learn via Datacamp. There they teach you the details of the language such that you get the syntax right. By doing their exercises you learn to type Python and recognize error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In class we then focus on applying these tools to economic problems. In class we also type Python and we also make mistakes which generate errors. So there is an overlap with the Datacamp lectures, but the focus in class is different. Further, in economics we are interested in optimization (we tend to maximize profits, utility etc.) and solving equations (specifically, solving for fixed points which give us equilibria). For this we use numpy and scipy, which is not covered much at the Datacamp courses that we do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most concepts you will first see at Datacamp and then we apply them in class. Sometimes it will be the other way around: we used something in class and you learn more details about it at Datacamp. This is perfectly fine. However, it is important that you keep up-to-date with Datacamp otherwise you are going to get lost. Also, programming is something that you need to practice. Play around with the notebooks that we do in class. Plot different functions, solve equations for different parameter values etc. Just looking at the answers that we give you in class will not help you to learn to use Python."
